    <p class="accordion-panel">
      When you think of IoT systems, you can not avoid one main aspect which is the communication between the devices. You do not see them, but they are there. It takes all the separated devices and makes a connected system out of it. Communication between devices involve a lot of different aspects such as the network, the communication protocols, the energy consumption, the security, and many others.
      <br><br>During this course, involving multiple different subjects, we had the opportunity to understand in more detail the importance of these aspects and the choices we would face in the future when implementing IoT systems.

  		<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Protocols for connected objects</h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>Communication protocols are formal descriptions of digital message formats and rules. They are required to exchange messages in or between computing systems. Communication protocols are important in telecommunications systems and other systems because they create consistency and universality for the sending and receiving of messages.
          <br><br>This class was presented in the form of lectures followed by student presentations on specific Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) protocols (group work)  and a vaster presentation of MAC protocols (individual work). Personally, I worked on the Sigfox protocol, more particularly on the MAC and physical layer. Moreover, since there are two of the main concerns when it comes to IoT systems, we analysed both the energy consumption of the protocol and the security mechanisms that it implemented. Although I probably remember more about this protocol I studied in detail, I also did learn about the other protocols presented by other students, like ZigBee, Nb-IoT, LoRa and BLE. The last two, I actually used during the innovative project I worked on.
          <br>In this course we also had the opportunity to do some labs focused on Software Defined Radio. You can click on this <a href="./SDR.html" class="link">link</a> for a more detailed version of the work done.

  		<h3 class="accordion-thumb">From 3G to 6G</h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
    		<p>This class was interesting in the sense that it covered more than the technical aspect of the studied technologies. It was mainly oriented towards 5G, but since most part of this class was based on students’ presentations who had an open choice regarding the subject.
          <br><br>I had the opportunity to learn more about the technical aspects of 5G, whether it is for the implementation of the technology for the different brands such as Apple or Huawei, or for the implementation of 5G in different domains such as the connected vehicle. I also learned about the consequences that such development would cause such as the pollution or the possible health issues which are not confirmed for now. I also learned about alternatives such as satellites constellations like Starlink or OneWeb.
          <br><br>The subject we chose was the global geopolitical challenges of 5G technology. It was interesting to see how much impact technologies can have in the world and reminded me that even though new technologies are developed to make our lives easier and that the capacity to keep improving and managing more and more complex tasks is impressive and should be encouraged, it needs to be though through. The impact such development has must not be neglected. Moreover, technologies can be used for the wrong purposes.

  		<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Emerging network</h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
    		<p>While the amount of IoT systems increased exponentially, the network paradigm also had to change drastically in order to answer these new needs. Indeed, one of those new characteristics is the mobility. When Internet was implemented the nodes were considered not mobile, because of that it did not handle that kind of issues. Solutions were then raised to answer the need such as Software Defined Networks (SDN) and the Locator Identifier Separation Protocol which were the ones we studied during this class.
          <br><br>SDN is an emerging architecture that is dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable, making it ideal for dynamic nature of today’s applications. This architecture decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services.
          <br>The LISP routing architecture design separates the device identity, or endpoint identifier (EID), from its location, or routing locator (RLOC). One main benefit of this protocol is that it does not require any change from the end nodes nor on the DNS layer. It only requires a minimal configuration on the LISP routers, is completely scalable and supports node mobility.
          <br><br>We have two labs dedicated to SDN in this class, however we got only one done for now which was mainly an introduction to OpenFlow.

      <h3 class="accordion-thumb">Digital Wireless Communications for connected objects</h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>This class raised the challenges faced by the development of wireless communication compared to the wired ones. Indeed, this induced several problems : interferences, lower performances, the need to share the medium, energy consumption, mobility management, security… Several network topologies were used to answer those needs:
          <ul>
            <li>Single-hop networks: based on cellular networks (2G, LTE, Nb-IoT), Low Power Wide Area Networks, WLAN. We already studied some of those protocols in more details in the class described in the previous part.  </li>
            <br>
            <li>Wireless Multi-hop networks: mesh, tree…</li>
          </ul>
          <br>We focused also on ways to adapt standard internetworking protocols for Wireless Sensor Network technologies. We studied 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) which allows IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks (technical standard for IoT which defines the operation of low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs)). Also adapted to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is a routing protocol for wireless networks with low power consumption. It is a proactive protocol based on distance vectors, optimized for multi-hop and many-to-one communication.

      <h3 class="accordion-thumb">Electrical Energy Storage and Harvesting</h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>An embedded system is an electronic system benefiting from limited resources in terms of signal processing and, being wireless, of limited energy resources. Such systems as IoT or sensor networks usually fall within the above category, provided they are not wired to a power network.
          <br><br>During this class, I learned different energy storage solutions that can be implemented onto the system. Electrochemical and electrostatic energy storage which include capacitors, batteries and fuel cells are technologies that have likely reach their maximum efficiency but represent still an interesting solution depending on the system. However, some systems require a better solution for instance if replacing the battery is difficult or too expensive or if it is simply not possible. In special environmental conditions some electrochemical batteries can represent a risk. I learned about several solutions based on energy harvesting or scavenging: solar, thermal, electromagnetic and kinetic energy harvesting.

      <h3 class="accordion-thumb">Security for network of connected objects </h3>
      <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>The development of IoT systems raises a major concern about security. Indeed, some systems exchange sensitive data and require to be protected from any external involvement. Moreover, an error in the system can also be dangerous depending on the system. It is important to know how to handle the errors that can occur or to prevent them. In this class, we learned how to implement a system, so it provides operating reliability. We also went through the weaknesses a system can present. Nonetheless, we did not finish the lectures yet, lectures in which I hope to learn more on how to protect IoT systems from those weaknesses. </p>

    <h1 class="accordion-thum">Difficulties and skills mobilized </h1>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
      <p>The main challenge I faced during this course is the quantity of information I had to apprehend in little time. Being from the electronic speciality made it even harder since some of the concepts were really new to me. Unfortunately, most part of the course was at the end of the year and we did not actually finish any of the few labs dedicated to this course. However, I found that addressing all these different aspects of IoT communications and protocols was relevant and interesting. Thanks to this course, I learned a lot and I am now able to understand better how the communications involved in IoT systems work but also I am able to make pertinent choices when it comes to it.
