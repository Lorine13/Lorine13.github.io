      <h1 class="accordion-thum">What I retained from ISS and my education at INSA ?</h1>
      <p class="accordion-panel">
        During this semester I acquired many technical skills complementing my embedded systems and electronic formation. Innovative Smart System is an expanding area that will define partially tomorrow’s world, which makes it interesting. Here I will not focus on those skills since I already detailed them in the different projects. A lot of areas have been covered in a little time, which made these last month’s intense. There are some projects that I would have liked to work on more deeply such as the Service Oriented Architecture project.
        <br><br>Important skills that I also developed during my years at INSA are the soft skills. I know how to express myself, to share my opinions but also to listen to others and comprise if needed. I know how to work alone as well as in teams. I can make decisions and I know how to handle conflicts. I can organise myself and manage my time in order to work efficiently. I can also show leadership if needed.
        <br><br>Finally, the special conditions in which the ISS training took place due to Covid taught me to be self-sufficient and responsible. It helped me understand what I wanted from this formation and to work for it on my own and for myself, despite the lack of obligations of having to be in class at specific times. It was important to me, to learn the most I could, to take all the opportunities I had to learn and to work for it.

      <h1>What writing this portfolio taught me ?</h1>
      <p class="accordion-panel">
        First of all, I used this opportunity to initiate myself to Web development by learning on the fly html, CSS and JavaScript programming which I think is a little added value to my professional profile. However, I have still a lot to learn and there is a lot I did not have time to implement. Moreover, I improved my writing skills in English, which is an important skill to have, especially since I plan to work abroad in the future.
        <br><br>More importantly and as said previously, I did learn a lot from this ISS training but writing about it and analysing each of the subjects made me realise how much and made me consider that I had learned more than I though during the previous years of my formation too. It helped me feel more confident for my future as an engineer.
