      We retrieve data, from everywhere, every machine, every people. The amount of data retrieved, particularly in certain fields can be tremendous which is why, it is important to process it and represent it in a relevant way. There are programming languages adapted to such processes, such as R. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
      <br><br>During this course we had to use R in order to explore and represent a chosen dataset. In our case, we chose a dataset concerning the Olympic Games called 120 years of Olympic Games history.

  		<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Exploring and representing a dataset</h3>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
              <p>Considering the data provided by the dataset, we decided on a problematic that could be answered by processing it. We wondered if it would it be possible to predict the future Olympic Games outcome with past data ? The answer to that question is obviously : not really. But we did find out characteristics that seem to tend to the type of athlete more likely to win in the future.
        <br><br>In order to do that we retrieved the dataset with R and made it a dataframe. We could then use it to explore it. We explored the data following those analyses :
        <ul>
          <li>Evolution of the number of events through editions depending on the sex of the athletes</li>
          <li>Evolution of the number of athletes through editions depending on their sex</li>
          <li>Top 5 countries in the Olympic Games ranking since 1896 </li>
          <li>Evolution over the years of athletes’ weight and height in the selected disciplines</li>
          <li>Radar chart comparing the mean weight and height of all the athletes and of only the winners for the selected disciplines</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Thanks to those analyses we could conclude that some countries are more likely to win medals, probably due to the access to best infrastructures, and the fact that such practices are more encouraged. We also found out that depending on the discipline practiced, the winners of the Olympic Games tend to a particular physic shape.</p>

    <p>
      The main challenge faced during this course, as expected, was to learn a new programming language from scratch. What made it harder was the fact that I never used programming in order to analyse an important amount of data. It was sometimes hard to say if the results were coherent since we did not know what to expect precisely. Moreover, I rarely, except in Matlab, represented data in graphics which in the end is an equally important part when it comes to data analysis, because having raw data is useless unless it is processed, but it also requires to be easily understandable by everyone.
      <br><br>During this project I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the R programming language but also about the importance of data analysis, which given the amount of data, requires to be optimised.
