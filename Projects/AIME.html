    <p class="accordion-panel">
      One of the fundamental parts, when it comes to IoT systems or smart devices, are the sensors. Indeed, most IoT systems require data on its environment in order to adapt to it, in a smart way. The data is collected through those sensors. These sensors must be chosen carefully, making sure that they answer the needs of our specific application, that is why it is important to know how to read a datasheet but also to know how to write one correctly in order for the potential users to have all the information required to make the best decision.
      <br><br>During this project, we created a nano particle gas sensor from scratch followed by a testing phase to evaluate the performances of the sensor and create a datasheet.
      <br>This sensor was later used in another project. We integrated it in an electronic circuit, designing also the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) with Kicad, that sent the gas values via a LoRa module to a web interface.

          <p>The manufacturing part was divided in 3 steps :
            <ul>
              <li><b>Development of  a microelectronic chip on a wafer</b>
                <br>We started by the last photolithography and the aluminium etching on the wafer already prepared by the technicians. Then, using a microscope, we selected on operational chip (without scratches) and cut it out of the wafer so that a technician could make the electric connections in a 10-lead TO-5 package.</li>
                <br>
              <li><b>Synthetization of tungsten trioxide nanoparticles</b>
                <br>Small combs silicon substrates fill with tungsten trioxide nanoparticles (WO3) deposit react to the ambient concentration of gas. In the lab, we synthetized the WO_3 germs and then made them grow in sticks.</li>
                <br>
              <li><b>Integration of the sensitive nanoparticles layer on the chip</b>
                <br>Using dielectrophoresis technique, we managed to place precisely the WO_3 sticks on the interdigitated combs (the dedicated space on the chip) to create a gas sensitive layer.
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>Eventually, in order to write the datasheet of our sensor, we electrically characterized the sensor at ambient temperature without gas and then  under different gases and temperatures in a controlled atmosphere.

    <p>
      The main challenge during this project was to understand what we were doing as we were doing it, since each step was precisely defined, and it was easy to follow the instructions without knowing the end to it.
      <br>Thanks to this opportunity, I learned a lot about how to design a sensor but also about the equipment required and the precautions to be taken. I, now, feel capable of understanding what is behind a sensor and to know how to read and write a datasheet, which can be considered as important as the manufacturing part.
